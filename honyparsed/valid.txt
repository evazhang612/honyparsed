My younger sister passed away last year from an unexpected stroke.  So I’m raising both my daughter and my niece.  In our culture, it’s an automatic.  It just kicks in.  She belongs to me now.  I’m a single mother so it’s not easy.  There are definitely months when I add up income and expenses and the numbers don’t work.  And both of them are thirteen so their moods are all over the place.  Today is like this, and tomorrow is like that.  But God has given us favor as well.  We can afford to share an ice cream.  We have shelter.  We have food.  And after four months of no work, I just found a new management position.  So we’ve come a long way.  My niece is beginning to heal.  Her grades are improving at school.  She still speaks of her mother in the present tense, but there’s no more crying at night.  And I’ve grown a lot as well.  Because more than I want to acknowledge, the struggle has given me meaning.  This is my purpose.  I have a little family.  And we share what little we have.(Johannesburg, South Africa)




I have nothing to complain about.  I’m originally from Sudan.  I love it there.  So many happy memories.  I got so much love from my family because I was the youngest.  Since then I’ve lived in five different countries and I’ve enjoyed every single one.  I don’t have a partner, but I have plenty of great friends.  I don’t have children, but I’m a lovely uncle.  I don’t take any medicine.  I sleep well.  I can walk around.  I don’t know what to say.  Every time I think about it, I conclude that I’m happy.  I wake up smiling.  I lived in Germany for several years.  And they have these cameras along the highway that photograph you when you’re speeding.  I’ve got a huge collection of photos because I love to speed.  It’s always just me alone in my car.  And I’m smiling in every one of them.(Johannesburg, South Africa)


(7/7)  While I was being interviewed on the radio, Carl Wilkens was attempting an impossible mission.  He’d gone to military headquarters, and begged the minister to let us transport children out of the orphanage.   He wanted to move them to a protected church near the UN Mission.  His request was denied because the children were Tutsi.  But then a miracle happened.  As he was leaving the building, the Prime Minister herself arrived for a meeting.  Carl ran up to her and began to plead for the children.  She told him to slow down and explain himself clearly.  Then not only did she grant him permission, but she offered two buses for the transportation.  Carl called me and told me to wait at the church.  He said he would bring the children to me.  I thought it was a suicide mission.  There were four hundred people hiding in the orphanage.  Many of them were malnourished and looked like fugitives.  It was clear they had been hiding out for months.  Why would the killers allow them to escape on buses?  But it was our only chance, so I came to the church and waited.  Carl told me the buses would arrive at 6 PM.  But there was no sign of them by 8 PM.  It had gotten completely dark.  I was losing hope.  But suddenly I heard people screaming: ‘Tutsis!  Tutsis!  Tutsis!’  The buses came around the curve, and pedestrians were chasing behind them.  Inside I could see five people piled into every seat.  The kids were hanging out the window, screaming: ‘Papa! Papa! Papa!’  Finally all of us were out of danger.  We sheltered in the church until the genocide was over, but it didn’t take long.  Three days later the capital was liberated.  And all of the children had survived.(Kigali, Rwanda)Nearly 5,000 people have donated to our fundraiser to help Damas as he continues to help underprivileged and traumatized children.  We just hit our goal.  Thanks so much everybody, Damas is thrilled.  Setting aside the dollar amount, it would be amazing if we could double the amount of donors.  From this point on, I’ll add an additional $1 from the HONY Patreon to every donation given.  Small amounts can have outsized impacts in developing countries.  So even if it’s only a few dollars, please consider being counted:




(6/7)  After people were discovered in the orphanage ceiling, the militia determined that I was a collaborator.  They held a high level meeting and passed a resolution to kill me.  I barely slept that night.  And the next morning I awoke to my name being called out over the radio.  It was the voice of the Minister of Social Affairs, and he was ordering me to report immediately to the radio station.  I was paralyzed with fear.  I didn’t know what to do.  Should I go there and be killed?  Or wait for them to come kill me?  I felt like locking myself away, but my brother forced me to make a decision.  So I decided to drive to the radio station.  The station director met me at the entrance, and informed me that I’d be doing a live interview on the radio.  It would be broadcast across the nation.  He sat me down in front of a microphone.  My mind was racing.  My hands were trembling, but I did my best to not sound nervous.  He started drilling me with questions.  He asked why there were so many rumors about the orphanage.  He asked if I was keeping any secrets.  He asked how many people I was hiding.  I steadied my voice.  I told him: ‘If I was hiding people, would I have come here to meet you?  I have nothing but children.  They’re just babies.’  He looked at me for a long time.  Then he finally spoke into his microphone: ‘Attention, militia!  Damas Gisimba is no longer a suspect.’(Kigali, Rwanda)




(5/7)  One night I was walking the property when I heard the children screaming.  They were saying, ‘Papa! Papa! Papa!’  The screams were coming from inside the office.  When I ran to see what was happening, I found that a group of killers had entered the building.  There were about fifteen of them.  They were wearing camouflage and carrying flashlights.  They had already begun to pull young men out of the ceiling.  I tried to stop them, but I was hit with the butt of a rifle.  The blow fractured my arm.  I didn’t dare to speak after that.  The killers were already angry.  If I annoyed them any more, they might harm the children.  Six young men were dragged into the kitchen.  They were beaten with pieces of wood that had nails sticking out.  The killers were screaming: ‘Where are the others?  Where are the others?’  At first the young men were begging for their lives, but their voices grew weak from loss of blood.  The children heard everything and kept trying to see what was happening.  I kept trying to chase them out of the room.  I yelled at them to go back to bed.  Eventually the young men were taken out to the bushes.  All night they were tortured.  I stood in the dark and listened to their voices.  We were hiding hundreds of people at that point.  I was sure they’d give everyone else away.  But they never spoke.  Their wives and family members were hiding in the ceiling, so they stayed silent until their deaths.  They saved all of us.  After the genocide, I built this memorial in their honor.        (Kigali, Rwanda)


(4/7) The militias would usually grow tired of killing people by 3 PM, and they would rest for the day.  That’s when I’d take people out of the ceiling to stretch their legs.  I’d circle the property.  I’d walk to a nearby pit where they threw dead bodies.  I’d listen closely to see if anyone was still alive, and I’d bring any survivors inside the orphanage.  During this time I lost all my emotions and feelings.  I became numb.  It seemed like any moment the militias would kill us, or a bomb would accidentally hit the orphanage.  And honestly I was ready for death.  It seemed like it would be the best thing for me.  My wife was also feeling hopeless.  We saw each other for just a few minutes every night.  She was busy trying to keep the babies alive.  She’d lost so much weight.  Her breast milk was gone.  And the children were barely alive.  They’d lost all of their muscle.  They were just skin and bones.  And we were almost out of food so I could no longer bribe the killers.  One day two men came in a truck asking for one of my employees by name.  They pretended that they had a child with them that needed medical treatment.  When she walked out to see the child, they pushed her into the truck and drove away.  Thankfully I was able to pull a baby out of her arms.  They killed her just a few meters from here, but it was too dangerous to recover her body until after the genocide.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(3/7)  Our most desperate problem was water.  The government had cut off our supply.  And we were packed so densely that the heat was unbearable.  Whenever we brought out jugs of water, one hundred liters would be consumed in less than a minute.  After two weeks we’d run out completely.  Then one morning I saw a car coming up the road.  It had the markings of the Adventist Church.  Out stepped a white man with a bulletproof vest.  His name was Carl Wilkens.  And he was the only American who had remained behind in Rwanda.  ‘I heard about you,’ he said.  ‘And I’ve come to encourage you.’  I took him around the property.  I showed him all the people I was hiding.  He could see that I was a nervous wreck.  So he began to pray with me.  He told me: ‘There is no way a man can survive this.  But God will help us through.’  I told Carl that we desperately needed water.  Without water we could not even cook our food.  So he promised me that he would try to help.  After that Carl would drive to the orphanage each week.  He’d bring water and milk for the kids.  And to this day, I don’t understand where he got it.  All of the stores were closed.  Carl was the only thing keeping us alive.  Every week I was convinced that he would be killed on the journey.  The roads were so dangerous.  People would shoot out his tires.  But every week he showed up with more water.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(2/7)  Over the next few days, the situation grew worse.  Bombs were being dropped all around us.  The streets had grown very loud.  The killers would chant and scream while they chased people.  All of the children were terrified.  We couldn’t hide the truth from them because they knew what was going on.  Some of the children who were arriving from the outside had witnessed their parents being killed.  Even the babies knew how to say: ‘Don’t kill me.  I’m not a Tutsi.’  The adolescent boys were especially vulnerable.  We hid them in the ceiling.  We had no fence around the orphanage back then, so there was nothing to protect us.  Just a line of trees.  Every day the militias would come looking for targets.  I'd meet them here at the entrance and try to bribe them with food.  I’d tell them: ‘I know your families are hungry.  Take this and go away.’  Luckily I had a shipping container full of porridge, corn, beans, and biscuits.  But word spread quickly.  The killers told each other: ‘If you tell Damas that you are going to kill his children, he will give you food.’  So more of them began to come.  And their demands grew larger.  So our food supply ran very low. And the people kept coming.  Eventually 400 people were being hidden in the orphanage.  We were like sardines in a can.  We had no food. No water.  No electricity.  No life.          (Kigali, Rwanda)




(1/7)  I inherited this orphanage from my father.  I was in my twenties at the time.  I had other dreams for my life, but the responsibility fell on me.  When my father passed away, he begged me: ‘Damas, please don’t abandon the children.’  So I promised him that I never would.  When the genocide began in 1994, I’d been managing the orphanage for several years.  I was thirty-three.  I was newly married.  I had a one-year-old child at home.  When I heard news of the president’s assassination, I immediately ran to comfort the children.  Gunfire had begun to enter the air.  We were housing about 65 children at the time.  Many of them were Tutsis.  I told the staff that nobody was allowed to leave the orphanage.  As the day passed, more and more people began arriving.  I had a reputation in the community for helping people.  So everyone came to me for shelter.  Their neighbors had turned against them.  Many of them were being chased by killers.  I knew that the penalty for sheltering Tutsis was death, but I didn’t have the heart to turn them away.  So I invited everyone inside.  I thought: ‘We have institutions in this country.  The United Nations is here.  The danger will be over soon.’(Kigali, Rwanda)




It might not seem possible for a nation to heal from genocide so quickly.  And some might think that our reconciliation is surface level.  But it runs deeper than that.  If we were truly a nation playing ‘make believe,’ our progress would have been impossible.  Rwanda’s per capita GDP has grown nearly 500% since the genocide.  And I understand that economics might seem like a dry subject, but you must consider what it represents.  It represents Rwandans working together.  And trading together.  And trusting each other.  It represents a consensus that our best future is a shared one.  Without true reconciliation, we’d have never come this far.  Do tribes still exist in Rwanda?  Of course.  There will always be divisions between us.  I can’t ask people to forget about these things.  But I tell them: ‘Consider the ways that we are a single tribe.  We all speak one language.  We all have the same culture, and dances, and behaviors.  So be proud of who you are.  But also be proud of being Rwandan.  Because that is something all of us are.(Kigali, Rwanda)




There was a huge puzzle after the genocide.  How do you pursue justice when the crime is so great?  You can’t lose one million people in one hundred days without an equal number of perpetrators.  But we also can’t imprison an entire nation.  So forgiveness was the only path forward. Survivors were asked to forgive and forget.  The death penalty was abolished.  We focused our justice on the organizers of the genocide.  Hundreds of thousands of perpetrators were rehabilitated and released back into their communities.  These decisions were agonizing.  I constantly questioned myself.  But each time I decided that Rwanda’s future was more important than justice.  It was a huge burden to place on the survivors.  And perhaps the burden was too great.  One day during a memorial service, I was approached by a survivor.  He was very emotional. ‘Why are you asking us to forgive?’ he asked me.  ‘Haven’t we suffered enough?  We weren’t the cause of this problem.  Why must we provide the solution?’  These were very challenging questions.  So I paused for a long time.  Then I told him: ‘I’m very sorry.  You are correct.  I am asking too much of you.  But I don’t know what to ask the perpetrators.  ‘Sorry’ won’t bring back any lives.  Only forgiveness can heal this nation.  The burden rests with the survivors because they are the only ones with something to give.’(Kigali, Rwanda)




(9/9)  This is a picture of my father before the genocide.  He’s surrounded by his Hutu friends.  They’re sharing beer.  They’re talking.  They always viewed him as a good person.  They’d even come to our home and flatter us.  They’d tell my sisters and me how good of children we were.  And that one day we’d marry their sons.  Many of these men would later help kill my family.  So how am I supposed to trust anyone?  Before the genocide, there were doctors taking care of their patients. Priests were taking care of their followers.  Neighbors were taking care of each other.  But none of that stopped them from killing each other.  And now we’re being asked to forgive.  Because our president tells us that reconciliation is the only path forward as a nation.  And I know that he’s right.  So I’m trying my best.  I’m spending time with Hutu people.  I even found two Hutu elders to mentor my son.  I want him to see that Hutus have good hearts.  My son even calls them ‘Grandpa.’  So I understand the need for reconciliation.  And I’m trying.  Christianity has helped me a great deal.  But true forgiveness is impossible.  My entire family was murdered.  How can I possibly forgive on behalf of those who can no longer speak for themselves?  It’s just not possible.  But I will certainly pretend.  Because I’ve seen where vengeance leads. (Butare, Rwanda)




(8/9) There were twelve people in my family before the genocide.  I’m the only one who survived.  We recovered eight of the bodies.  And we buried the bones we were able to find.  I didn’t trust anyone after the genocide.  Even when I was rescued by the Rwandan Patriotic Front, I wouldn’t take the food I was given.  I thought it might be poisoned.  So I’d eat raw food from the fields.  I was losing so much weight but I didn’t care.  People looked at me like I was a statue.  They assumed my emotions were frozen.  They knew my family was dead, and didn’t want to ask me questions.  So I held it all in for decades.  Who could I talk to anyway?  In a nation of one million victims, how do I begin to tell my story?  There’s been too much tragedy for everyone.  Some people lost their arms and legs.  Other people were raped and given HIV.  What makes my story worth telling?  Who am I?  Why should I ask for sympathy?  And who would I even ask?  So I never asked anyone.  I’ve never asked anyone for a thing.  I don’t want anyone to take care of me.  I don’t want people to celebrate my birthday.  Or cook for me.  Or tell me sweet words.  I’m fine with giving love.  But I can’t accept it.  Because I don’t want anything that can ever be taken away.(Butare, Rwanda)




(7/9)  I woke up to find that I’d been discovered by a soldier.  He dragged me to my feet and led me down the street to this alleyway.  He pointed his gun at me, and told me to say goodbye to my life.  At that point I felt ready to die.  But that’s when Mary came running out of her house.  She fell at the soldier’s feet and began pleading with him.  ‘Leave this girl for me,’ she said.  ‘You’ve killed her entire family.  Just leave this one for me.  God sent her to me.’  She offered the soldier all of her money.  She told him:  ‘When the war is over, you can come back and take this girl for a wife.’  And that’s what finally convinced him.  He handed me over.  Mary took me inside and cooked me food.  She gave me a change of clothes.  She tried to wash my hair, but it was too thick, so she cut it all off.  Then she hid me in the bushes behind her house.  I stayed there for weeks.  Every night Mary would bring me porridge and water.  She gave me a little radio so I could follow the news reports.  Each day the rebels were getting closer to our town.  Mary would encourage me.  She’d tell me that it would all be over soon.  And that I’d be rescued.  She promised me that I’d survive.  And Mary was right.  I did survive, because of her.(Butare, Rwanda)




(6/9)  The next morning, I heard people calling my name and I decided to show myself.  I was too exhausted to resist.  They told me there had been a general pardon for women and children.  And all of us who believed the rumor were taken to this place, the house of a Tutsi widow.  I found my mother and sisters when I arrived.  They were still alive, but were so weak and depressed that they could barely move.  We stayed in this house for two weeks.  There were sixteen of us here.  Then one night a soldier came and told us that we were scheduled to be executed.  My mother urged my younger sisters to run away, but none of them wanted to leave her side.  I begged Francine to escape with me.  She was the oldest.  We had a chance.  But she was too tired.  She’d been raped a few days earlier.  She told me she was ready for death.  Eighty soldiers came to the house that night.  They were carrying a list with our names.  They began grabbing people.  During the struggle, I jumped out the window and hid in a tree.  My mother was forty-eight years old.  Francine was sixteen.  Olivia was fourteen.  Noella was eleven.  Augtavienne was seven.  Claudette was four.  And Bebe was almost two.  I listened to their screams until I fainted.(Butare, Rwanda)


(5/9)  On the day I watched my father die, this is the skirt I was wearing.  I was only twenty-one years old.  I completely lost my will to live.  I walked down the street like a zombie.  I came to this house.  The owner wasn’t home at the time because she was busy looting my family’s home.  I tried to hide under her bed, but there was another Tutsi man there.  He began yelling at me to leave.  ‘It’s too small,’ he said.  ‘You’ll get us both killed.’  So I ran outside to jump in the toilet, but the killers were already at the door.  They dragged the man out from under the bed and killed him before my eyes.  They were about to kill me too, but the team leader said he had ‘other plans for me.’  And everyone listened to him because he had a gun.  He started leading me toward a plantation.  He told me to comply or he’d kill me.  He made me lie down on the ground.  He unbuttoned his shirt, lay down next to me, and tried to spread my legs.  So I grabbed his balls and squeezed as hard as I could.  He started trying to punch me.  So I squeezed them harder and twisted.  He kept writhing around but I didn’t let go until he fainted.  Then I began running through the dark.  I couldn’t see a thing.  I fell into a latrine full of shit, and I remained there all night because I was too tired to move. (Butare, Rwanda)




(4/9)  Our family was a top target because my father was so prominent.  So when the genocide officially commenced, the killing squads came straight to our home.  One of our neighbors peeled away from the group and ran ahead to warn us.  He came down our street, screaming at the top of his lungs:  ‘Run away!’ They are coming to kill you!’  My mother immediately dropped to her knees and started to pray.  My father yanked her off the ground.  He told us all to get out.  Everyone ran in different directions.  I don’t know why we split up, but there was gunfire and screaming all around.  I followed my mother and sisters to a nearby plantation.  The baby was with us.  We stayed there for four days.  But I didn’t feel comfortable.  All around I could hear people hunting for us.  They were calling our names.  We needed to find a new place.  I begged my mother and sisters to run away with me, but they were too depressed.  They didn’t have the energy to move.  So I went alone and returned to our house.  I was looking for our father.  I crouched down in a nearby bush and waited for him to return.  Early in the morning a crowd of people came marching over the hill.  My father was in the center.  He was so tall that I could see his face.  They marched him to this very spot, because he’d asked to be killed at his own home.  I could see everything from the bush.  I closed my eyes.  I said: ‘Please God, please change this man.  Please make it a different person.’  But when I opened my eyes—it was still his face.  I saw everything.  And the whole time I was trying to imagine it wasn’t him.  But when I opened my eyes, it was always him.  They finished him off with machetes.  When they finally left, I walked over to look at his body.  He was seconds away from death.  But he was still moving his head back and forth.       (Butare, Rwanda)




(3/9)  If you are being hunted, this bush is one of the best places to hide.  Every genocide survivor in Rwanda can tell you about this type of bush.  It’s full of thorns.  But if you crawl on your stomach, you can get inside.  And if you can get inside, you can finally take a rest.  The best hiding places are always the most dangerous ones.  Farms were no good.  Everyone who tried to hide on a farm was discovered.  Toilets were no good either.  Because that’s where they dumped the bodies.  You wanted to find a place where the killers were afraid to go.  The higher the risk, the less chance of getting caught.  Swamps were one of the most popular choices because there were so many ways to die in there.  It was easy to get stuck in the mud and drown.  Most of us couldn’t swim.  Or the mosquitos could give you malaria.  Or you could be killed by a single snakebite.  But the worst were the crocodiles.  I’d say fifty percent of the people who hid in the swamps were eaten by crocodiles.  My brother tried hiding in a swamp.  And he actually survived all these things.  He made it all the way to the border with Burundi.  But then a helicopter dropped fuel from above and set his swamp on fire.           (Butare, Rwanda)




(2/9)   When the presidential plane was shot down, people began to gossip about the impending genocide.  The streets were empty.  Nobody was travelling long distances.  We started to hear tales of violence.  Relatives from other regions would arrive on our doorstep with horror stories.  My father came home one day and told us about a Tutsi janitor at the university.  He cleaned clothes for the students.  That day he’d been tortured to death with his own iron.  I grew very depressed during this period.  I wanted to be alone all the time.  Some nights my family would sleep in a nearby church for safety, but I’d remain in the house alone.  I could feel something terrible in the air.  Then on April 21st, the genocide officially came to our town.  The militia gathered up Tutsi pedestrians in the city center.  They brought them to this stadium.  There were 200 people in all.  They put them in lines.  Then they opened the doors and invited the public to fill the seats.  The governor was forced to sit in the front row.  He had mixed blood and was against the genocide.  After the last person was executed, they brought the governor down and killed him too.  His body was paraded through the streets.  The killers were screaming into an intercom: ‘We’ve killed the governor!  Anything is possible!  Now let the hunt begin.’        (Butare, Rwanda)




(1/9)   My father was well respected in the community.  He was a university lecturer and a choir member.  But he was always working, so my mother was primarily the one who raised us.  Her name was Consolee.  She had this deep sorrow about her.  She was an orphan because her parents had been killed in the 1963 genocide.  Whenever we asked her to tell the story of our grandparents, she’d just say: ‘Give it time.  Soon you’ll see for yourself.’  I tried to help her as much as I could.  The eldest daughter acts like a mother in our culture, so I raised my six younger sisters.  They thought I was too strict.  They were always saying that I behaved like a nun.  But they looked up to me too.  And they loved me.  Occasionally I’d help to keep them out of trouble.  When my sister Francine cut her foot on a bottle, she was terrified to tell our mother because she wasn’t supposed to be barefoot.  I helped her conceal the crime by cutting a hole in the bottom of her shoe.  At night all my sisters would pile into my bed.  They’d beg me to tell them stories.  And I always did, until they fell asleep, and I’d carry them into their beds one by one.  The youngest was a boy.  He always took the longest because I had to rock him to sleep.  His name was Edmond Richard, but we called him ‘Bebe.’  He was was 1.5 years old when the genocide began.(Butare, Rwanda)




(6/6)  I was given the opportunity to visit Rwanda as part of my internship with the US Senate.  I was accompanying an important delegation.  But they must have thought I was crazy, because when we arrived in Rwanda, I began speaking to people in the streets.  I was convinced that everyone looked like me.  I wanted to find members of my family.  I wanted to see my old school.  I wanted to find my old house.  But all I could remember was the location of my grandmother’s house because it had been so close to the airport.  So that’s where we went.  We knocked on the door.  I didn’t reveal my identity.  When I asked the current resident if he knew about me, he told me that I had been killed.  But then he said that some of my family was still alive.  He told us that my sister was working at a nearby market.  So we decided to drive there.  The sun was going down.  At this point I was sure that I’d lost my mind.  Because we drove by a playground, and I saw a little boy that looked exactly like me.  I even took his photo.  I had no idea that he was my brother.  When we arrived at the market, it was almost completely dark.  But I saw my sister.  And she saw me.  She recognized me immediately because of the scar on my forehead.  Our brother had given me this scar when we were toddlers.  He didn’t survive the genocide.  When my sister saw me, we embraced.  We both started crying.  And she told me everything that happened while I was gone.  And I won’t share the details, because those aren’t my stories to tell.  But she gave me the biggest news of all.  I remember picking up the phone, and immediately calling Anne Peterson.  I told her: ‘Mom, you’re not going to believe this.  But I just found my mother.’(Kigali, Rwanda)———————————————–  If you are wondering why Nyanja is back in Rwanda, it’s because she has founded an organization called Little Hills, which aims to improve health services for children in Rwanda.  Her ultimate goal is to build a children’s hospital.  She’s created a small fundraiser, which I’ve kicked off with a $5,000 donation from the HONY Patreon.  If you’d like to empower Nyanja in the next phase of her life, and help improve healthcare for children in Rwanda, you may do so here:




(5/6)  During high school I got a lot of counseling.  I began to process what had happened to me.  I remember in tenth grade we had an English teacher who used to tell us to look in the mirror every morning and say: ‘I’m good and I’m beautiful.’  But I would always add: ‘And I’m extremely lucky.’  I’d look at myself closely and try to recognize my mother.  I started reading a lot of books.  One of them was called Anne of Green Gables, about an orphan girl who was different.  I decided that I was going to be like Anne and not let my bad luck ruin my life.  I went to college at Washington State.  I got an internship to work in the US Senate.  I even dreamed about one day becoming Secretary General of the United Nations.  But it was during this time that I also began to meet other people who’d escaped from Rwanda.  I listened to their stories.  And I began to realize the full context of what happened during the genocide.  I read about it obsessively.  I learned that the world had abandoned Rwanda.  The United Nations may have saved me, but they failed everyone else.  One million people were left to die.  At first I felt angry.  Then the anger turned into guilt.  Why had I survived?  For the longest time I didn’t even want to tell my story.  Because I didn’t want to give the United Nations any credit.  I didn’t want my story being used to put a positive spin on the situation.  I felt confused and conflicted.  But then at the age of twenty-one, I was given an opportunity to return to Rwanda.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(4/6)  After a year we were chosen for resettlement in the United States.  As soon as we arrived, I was separated from my grandmother.  She was put in a nursing home, and two months later she passed away.  It was the first time I’d cried since I left Rwanda.  She was all I had left.  I lived with my uncle for awhile but he was very abusive.  He treated me like a maid.  So I was removed from the home and put into foster care in Boise, Idaho.  But that was also a bad situation.  I was on the verge of running away.  And I’m pretty sure my social worker informed my school.   Because my art teacher started asking me about my plans.  Her name was Anne Peterson.  She was one of those teachers that you could talk to about anything.  So I answered all her questions.  I told her my story.  And I started bragging about my plan to take care of myself.  I think she decided: ‘Absolutely not.’  Because that’s when she chose to become my Mom.  Oh my God, it was amazing.  Ms. Peterson lived in a big, beautiful house.  I was the only child there.  I had my own room.  It was safe.  I didn’t have to worry about surviving.  Mom took care of everything.  She would wake me up to go to school every day.  She always made sure I had lunch.  She took me out to eat at restaurants.  It was amazing.  I was already fifteen years old.  But for the first time in years, I felt like a kid.

(3/6)  The plane took us to a refugee camp in Nairobi, Kenya.  It would be our home for the next year.  When I finally learned what was going on, I became one hundred percent convinced that my mother had been killed.  Other refugees were telling me stories.  Many of them had lost their entire families.  My uncle told me that everyone in our neighborhood had been captured, and he was almost positive that my mother was dead.  Surely if my mother was alive, she would have come for me.  My grandmother’s house was not far from our home.  So I accepted the truth.  But I didn’t have much time to think about it.  Because we had to fight for survival in the refugee camp.  My grandmother was paralyzed and couldn’t chew hard food.  So I’d spend my days trying to find her things to eat.  I’d negotiate with people for their eggs and bananas.  I spent the rest of my time by her side.  She couldn’t move so I had to keep the flies away.  But it wasn’t all bad.  I made friends with a few of the other kids in camp.  And I remember one time we stole money from the adults.  We snuck out of the camp and bought French fries from a roadside shop.  They were horrible quality.  They came in a little plastic bag.  But at the time I remember thinking they were the best thing I’d ever tasted.  (Kigali, Rwanda)




(2/6)  We stayed in the house for two nights.  On the third morning a neighbor warned us that the killing groups were coming our way, so we decided to leave without packing anything.  We were fortunate because my grandmother lived right next to the airport.  Her house backed right up to the airstrip, and it was one of the few places in the city still under the protection of the United Nations.  So my uncle cut a hole in the fence, and we began running toward some old trucks.  We couldn’t run very fast because we were pushing my grandmother in her wheelchair.  On the way I lost one of my yellow flip-flops.  I remember thinking: ‘My mother is going to kill me when I see her again.’  So I tried to turn back, but the adults screamed at me to keep running.  Finally we reached one of the old trucks and climbed beneath it.  We stayed under that truck for a week.  The UN knew we were there, but they left us alone.  Occasionally I’d run out and ask the soldiers for food.  There was one soldier in particular who always gave me biscuits and sardines.  He felt sorry for me because I was so small.  And when the UN finally evacuated, he came and got us.  They put us in the back of a cargo plane with some containers.  Nobody explained anything to me.  I was cold.  I was hungry.  I was tired.  All I wanted to do was go home and see my mother. (Kigali, Rwanda)


(1/6)  I was only ten years old at the time so I don’t remember much.  Nobody explains things to you when you’re a child.  I was never told that I was different.  Or that some people wanted to kill us.  My mother basically raised me by herself, but it wasn’t an unhappy childhood.  I do remember feeling afraid sometimes.  I remember occasionally being kept home from school.  And I remember not being allowed to play freely in the streets.  But these things were never fully explained to me.  When the genocide began, I was visiting my grandmother.  It was a school holiday.  I’d made good grades that semester, so my mother had bought me a pair of yellow flip-flops as a reward.  I was obsessed with them.  I remember waking up that morning and realizing something strange was going on.  I could hear gunshots outside and people screaming.  My grandmother told me to stay inside the house.  She’d recently had a stroke and was confined to a wheelchair, so it was just me and her alone in the room.  Eventually I got bored and decided to sneak outside to see what was happening.  All the streets were empty except for young boys with machetes.  That’s when my uncle came over, and I overheard him telling one of the maids that it was extremely dangerous outside.  He said that all of us might be killed.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(3/3)  When I woke up, I found myself lying alongside a very deep pit.  It was full of bodies.  My stepfather was standing over me.  Somehow he had learned about the attack, and had come with his bodyguards to rescue me.  He picked me off the ground.  I was barely conscious.  When we returned home, my stepfather called the government to complain about what had happened.  But he was told to watch his back.  He was told that our family was no longer under protection.  My mother begged me stop helping people.  She told my bodyguards to not let me leave the house.  But by that time the Rwandan Patriotic Front was getting very close to our village.  The fighting grew very intense.  My family packed everything and fled toward the border with Congo.  Four of my sisters were killed on the journey.   I remained behind with the seventy people.  Our bodyguards were gone.  We were helpless.  We had no guns.  We just prayed the rebels would liberate us as soon as possible.  I knew the killing groups would be coming to my home, so I gathered all the remaining biscuits and water.  I took everyone to the house of someone who had already been murdered.  It seemed like the safest place to be.  I closed them inside and padlocked the door.  Then I finally ran off to reunite with my family.  I learned later that everyone in that house was rescued.  Only four of the seventy lost their lives.  And almost all of them are still alive today.  We remain friends.  We’re still neighbors.  They bring me gifts.  I see them in the streets almost every day, and whenever we meet, they show me their love.    (Kigali, Rwanda)




(2/3)  The killings were being encouraged by the national radio station.  Every day they would announce how many people had been killed.  They’d announce the location of the killings.  And they’d give thanks to those who were doing the killing.  One morning I was sitting in my bedroom, and I heard an announcement on the radio: ‘Everyone is being killed in Gatobotobo except for those under the protection of the Felix family.’  I knew then that we were in danger.  Not long after the announcement, the Minister of Internal Security came to our village for a meeting.  It took place on a hill overlooking our property.  He could see everything that was happening in our compound.  When he left the meeting, his convoy began driving toward our home.  The minister was riding in a truck full of armed soldiers.  When he passed by me in the street, the truck slammed on the brakes.  All my bodyguards ran away and I was left completely alone.  My neighbors began to gather around.  They were laughing and applauding and saying, ‘This is the guy who was stopping the killings.’  The minister walked over to me.  He pushed me on the ground and leaned over my body.  He was covered with sweat.  His eyes were wide.  There was dried spit on the edges of his lips.  He had the face of the devil.  He took off his belt and began beating me until I lost consciousness.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(1/3)  The genocide was an opportunity to get rich.  Murdering people was the quickest way to accumulate wealth.  We were given permission from the government to seize the property of anyone we killed.  We were told it was our god given right.  But I never felt the temptation.  My family owned a very big supermarket.  I had my own car.  When the killings began in 1994, I had a scholarship to study in Greece and I was just waiting to begin university.  My stepfather was Vice President of our region, so we had four bodyguards in the house.  These guys were highly trained with automatic weapons.  They became good friends of mine.  I’d take them to the bar every night.  I’d drive them around and buy them anything they wanted.  They were also good human beings.  One night over drinks we discussed the genocide, and all of us decided: ‘We’re going to put an end to this in our neighborhood.’  The next morning I woke up to my neighbor screaming.  I looked out the window and saw that he’d been surrounded by a mob with machetes, and was bleeding badly from the head.  I’d been friends with him since childhood.  So I sent my bodyguards to save him.  The machetes were no match for our guns.  Word spread quickly after that.  Tutsi families came to our compound seeking refuge.  I took long walks with my bodyguards every morning, looking for people to save.  We drove to surrounding farms and searched the fields for survivors.  At one point we had seventy people under our protection.  Nobody challenged us.  I was young and cocky.  I thought we were untouchable.(Kigali, Rwanda)




My father was a talented engineer.  He could fix any type of truck, and he used his income to help the poor.  Our neighbors’ school fees and hospital bills were always paid.  My mother would bring needy people to our table, and order us to give them the best portions of meat.  She’d explain that these people rarely had the chance to eat well.  Both my parents were very religious.  But they always taught us: ‘Humanity first.  Everything else comes after.’  When the genocide began, they invited our Tutsi neighbors to hide in our house.  There were seven of them.  Some lived under the beds.  Others lived in the cupboards.  I was a teenager back then and my job was to change the waste buckets.  It was a miserable existence, and it went on for months.  But we prayed with them.  We tried to give them hope.  We told them that God was in control.  At night we’d give them Muslim dress so they could go in the backyard and get fresh air.  Our neighbors suspected us because our curtains were always closed.  We never slept because we knew the penalty for hiding Tutsis was death.  But all seven people in our house survived.  Unfortunately my mother and father died a few years ago, so I must tell their story for them.  Their names were Mukamunosi Adha and Gasano Juma.  They saved seven lives.  And they valued love and humanity more than anything.  (Kigali, Rwanda)




(4/4)  I managed to escape that day, but things had grown desperate.  In the end there were two thousand of us trying to survive.  We’d begun to run out of food.  The militia was losing on the battlefield and began to grow frustrated.  Two days before our rescue, they came to the church for a final big attack.   They were going in every room.  They were finding everyone.  Some of the mothers were lying on mattresses over their sons, trying to hide them.  But it was no use.  I’d managed to climb into the ceiling.  I’d poked holes in the exterior wall so I could breathe.  Through those holes I could see everything that was happening outside.  They tied every boy up, two-by-two.  They brought them to this exact spot and began to beat them.  Their mothers were screaming and crying from inside the building.  One group of boys was pulled to the center.  These were my friends.  We played soccer together.  We studied together.  Sebajura.  Galindo.  Muyoboke. Jean Bosco, he was a believer.  They walked up to Jean Bosco and kicked him in the head.  They told him: ‘We know you are a friend of Masengo. Tell us where he is.’  And Jean Bosco knew.  He knew where I was.  He’d seen me climb into the ceiling.  But he didn’t say a word.  So they beat him harder.  They kept saying: ‘Tell us, tell us, tell us.’  But he kept silent.  He kept silent until his last breath.  And then they shot him.  Jean Bosco died because of me.  He died for me.  Seventy-two young men died that day.  The crowd screamed the entire time.  But that night when I finally climbed down from the ceiling, everyone was silent.  Nobody was saying a word.(Kigali, Rwanda)




  One morning the killers brought a list of names, and gathered everyone together.  They told us to sit on the floor.  They stepped through the crowd and began reading out the names.  My name was called out, but it was misspelled by one letter.  They kept shouting ‘Marengo’ instead of ‘Masengo.’  But I knew it was me they were looking for.  They told the crowd: ‘If you give up these people, we won’t come back to kill your sons and daughters.’  But nobody spoke.  The killers were examining one person at a time.  I sat with my head between my knees.  Back then I had the face of a girl, so I tried to cover myself with fabric.  Some of the killers were from my neighborhood.  I knew that when they got around to me, I would be recognized.  So I slipped out and ran toward a banana plantation.  One of them spotted me and alerted the others.  I jumped over a brick fence and dove into the tallest grasses I could find.  Soon I heard footsteps.  They were walking all around me.  I remember one of them saying: ‘Cockroaches are so mysterious.  How are they able to disappear?’  He got so frustrated that he hacked at a banana tree with his machete.  The leaves fell on my legs.  I was lying with my cheek on the dirt.  I remember the exact time because my watch was next to my face.  It was 12:22 PM.  I remember thinking: ‘This is the time I’m going to die.    (Kigali, Rwanda)


(2/4)  The conditions were tolerable at first.  We were eating twice a day.  We could take showers.  But people kept pouring into the church compound.  Eventually there were two thousand of us.  All the young men began sleeping in the ceiling.  Women and children slept on the floor.  Beds were given to the elderly.  All of the priests abandoned us except for one.  His name was Celestin Hakizimana, and he stayed with us until the very end.  Every day he’d put on his gown, and stand right here at the gate.  When the killers arrived, he would tell them: ‘We only have innocents here.  Go find the enemy on the battlefield.’  If they refused to leave, he would take them to the church office and bribe them with money.  Once the killers tried to lure him from the compound by saying his father was dead, and that he was needed at the funeral.  But he told them: ‘Please send my blessings.’  He wouldn’t abandon us.  If any survivors knew the location of their family, Father Celestin would do his best to find them. He would put on his gown and drive out into the world.  One night he came back bloodied and beaten.  He had been stopped at a roadblock, laid down in the road, and kicked in the street.  But the next day he put on his gown once more, and drove out into the world.  He couldn’t always keep the killers out.  Some days they’d come with lists of people to kill.  And there was nothing he could do. He’d do his best to fool them by creating a registry of fake names.  But then they would choose people randomly.  They’d drag out twenty people at a time and bring them to their death.  Nothing could be done.        (Kigali, Rwanda)


  When we heard the president had been killed, I ran into the street with my friends.  We wanted to see what was happening.  Immediately two men came running after us with guns.  They were pointing at us and screaming: ‘You killed the president!’  All of us ran in different directions.  I ducked into a neighbor’s house and climbed into the ceiling, but my shoes fell off and landed on the bed.  The men discovered my shoes and they climbed into the ceiling after me.  Luckily I squeezed into a place they could not fit.  But when they finally left, the owner of the house told me I had to find another place.  He told me that people were hiding at the church of St. Paul, and that I should go there.  I left at 3 AM.  I walked through the forest.  I could hear gunfire and screaming in the dark.  The church was less than a kilometer away but the journey took me two hours.  When I finally arrived, I discovered hundreds of other survivors.  We were housed in the building behind me.  Every hour more people would arrive.  Each time a newcomer came through the front door, we would rush to them for news.  I learned that my brothers had been killed.  They had run to a nearby church, but the pastor opened its doors to the killers.  Another person told me that my mother had been killed.  She’d taken refuge in a nuns’ compound.  She was randomly chosen for death and shot in the head at 10 AM.  She lived until 5 pm.  But by the time I heard this, I couldn’t even cry.  I was completely numb.  I was just waiting to die myself.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(3/3) The killers formed a search party the next morning.  They gathered at the top of the hill.  We could see them coming toward us, searching every house along the way, and pulling out more people to join the hunt.  The mob was growing very big.  I knew that the end was upon us.  But the fighting was very intense that day.  Rockets were flying over our head, and some of them began landing on the hill.  One landed so close to the search party that they scattered in different directions.  I pulled everyone out of the hiding place and moved them to the forest behind our house.  Every night I’d wait until the streets were empty, and I’d bring them food.  For two weeks it went on like this.  I rationed what little we had. I lost all my weight because I was too scared to eat.  My breasts completely disappeared.  I didn’t even feel like a woman anymore.  I’d nearly given up on life.  Every morning I’d pray for the day to finish.  And every night I’d pray for the morning to come.  My husband wanted us to escape.  The only reason we remained in Kigali was to feed those people.  And after three weeks the capital finally fell.  The Rwandan Patriotic Front was advancing, and the Hutu boarded busses to flee the city.  Even the people who were hiding told me to abandon them.  So I gave them each a final ration of food and escaped.  But all of the people hiding on this property were rescued.  And every single one of them is alive today.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(2/3)  It was too dangerous to hide the man in the house.  So I brought him to this small room in the back, which we sometimes rented to tenants.  I pushed him inside and locked the door.  When I was opening our shop the next morning, another man came running to me for help.  He was limping badly.  He was out of breath and drenched in sweat.  I recognized him as a prominent Tutsi businessman.  ‘Save my life!’ he screamed.  ‘They are chasing me!’  So I quickly pulled him to the back of the house and locked him in this same room.  A few minutes later the killers arrived.  They searched all over the main house, but never checked the back room.  Over the next few days, six more people came looking for help.  We hid them all.  But my neighbors had been spying on us.  They reported everything.  And one night the killers showed up with guns.  When they knocked on the door, my husband started shivering and couldn’t stand up.  I told him: ‘You’re the man of the house. You must stand firm and face them.’  But he couldn’t move.  So I went to the door myself.  The killers were standing there with a list of the people hiding in our house. ‘Where are these cockroaches?’ they said.  I tried to tell them that we had no cockroaches, but they pushed past me and started searching.  They beat my husband until he was unable to speak.  I offered them all the money we had, and only then did they stop.  But they told us that they’d be coming back during the daylight for a house-to-house search.(Kigali, Rwanda)


(1/3)  My husband and I were shopkeepers at the time of the genocide.  We sold groceries on one side of the shop, and on the other side we had a bar.  On the night the president’s plane was shot down, the place was full. Everyone was dancing and listening to music.  We heard a large explosion but didn’t think anything of it.  Everyone just went back to dancing.  But the next morning people began shopping frantically.  We were selling food in large quantities.  When we were down to the last 100 kilograms of potatoes, I decided not to sell anymore.  I could tell that danger was coming.  Nobody came to the bar that night.  The streets were empty and quiet.  People were either planning violence, or they were hiding.  We were one of the first cities to be liberated during the genocide.  So almost immediately there was fierce fighting throughout the city.  The killers knew they had to murder as quickly as possible.  They were herding groups of Tutsis onto bridges and shooting them all.  My husband and I had a reputation for being friendly with Tutsis, so we were suspected of being traitors.  Our neighbors began watching us closely.  We feared for our lives.  We had a lot of property, so we knew there was a big incentive to murder us.  When the first Tutsis came to us looking for shelter, we turned them away.  But one night I was walking near the house, and I heard a close friend calling to me from a tree.  He was dying of hunger.  It had been raining all day.  I said to myself: ‘The property isn’t worth it,’ and I invited him inside.  I didn’t even inform my husband.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(4/4)  The journey to the border took nearly four hours.  Our pace was very slow because there were so many kids in the group, and everyone was weak from hunger.  We had to avoid the main roads.  Thankfully I’d mapped out the route so I could find our path in the dark.  All of us were frightened.  Even if we heard an animal, everyone would jump.  When we arrived at the border, I pointed the group toward Burundi and headed back to camp.  I was confident that I’d avoided detection.  Several days passed without incident.  I even managed to run one more mission with a mother and child.  But somehow news leaked out.  And one night when I was returning from patrol, a Tutsi solider met me at the door of the barracks.  He was out of breath.  ‘You are already dead,’ he said. ‘They will torture you.’  I thought he was just being paranoid, but then I heard my name being called out on the radio.  Orders were given to shoot me on sight.  I left everything behind and began to run.  I hopped over the fence.  I didn’t stop running until I arrived at the border.  The next time anyone saw me, I was on television bearing witness to the crimes I had seen.(Kigali, Rwanda)


  Our base was only twenty kilometers from the border with Burundi.  After the first day of killings, I rode to the border on a bicycle, just to study the route.  I knew that I was taking a giant risk.   But I was a religious person.  I was a Christian before I was a soldier.  So for me, killing innocent people was more of a risk than trying to help them escape.  Many Tutsi families were part of my church community.  I had prayed with them many times.  So when one of them reached out for help, I could not refuse.  They told me their neighbors had just been murdered.  They feared they were next.  So I told them to gather in one place and meet me at midnight.  I snuck out of the camp.  I told my roommate to tell everyone I was sick on the toilet.  When I got to the meeting place, I was expecting to find one family, but there were twenty-three people waiting.  Many of them were too scared to come out of the bush.  They saw my uniform and thought I was leading them to their death.  But the mother of the family gathered everyone together for prayer.  She said: ‘Lord, we are frightened.  But we are going to trust our brother in Christ to take us to safety.’(Kigali, Rwanda)


(2/4)  There had always been permission to kill any Tutsis we discovered while on patrol.  But on April 6th our instructions became very clear: every Tutsi was to be found and killed.  It was even said over the radio.  Our first official order was to drive to a nearby city and open fire on unarmed civilians.  Most soldiers carried out the orders with glee.  The hatred had sunk into their core.  Let it be remembered that the killings were pursued with pride, passion, and determination. Soldiers fired indiscriminately at people walking down the road.  I pretended to participate, but I didn’t pull the trigger.  That night we returned to the camp and everyone swapped stories.  They bragged about how many people they’d killed.  It became a competition.  Soldiers would radio from other bases, and say: ‘We’ve killed so many already.  Why can’t you keep up?’  All of it was sickening.  I couldn’t eat for weeks.  But it was most traumatizing for the Tutsi soldiers in our army.  My roommate was a Tutsi.  He had to pretend like he was enjoying the murder of his friends and family.  He had to laugh along with the others to save his own life.  He could only remove his mask with me.  And he was the only one that I trusted with my plan.(Kigali, Rwanda)




  When I was twelve years old, they undressed a Tutsi girl in front of my entire school.  They wanted to see if her private parts were the same as other people.  She kept trying to cover herself with her hands while they pulled out her hairs one by one.  I can still hear the laughter.  Even with all the violence that came later, that was the most traumatic moment of my life.  It’s still the image I see when I’m trying to fall asleep.  The genocide didn’t begin until many years later, when I was twenty-five years old.  I was a soldier in the army.  I could tell the atmosphere was growing more and more tense.  Our commanders were openly using ethnic slurs.  There was talk of ‘wiping our enemies from this country.’  One night I was assigned to guard four Tutsi prisoners.  They’d been accused of making explosives but were clearly innocent civilians.  They’d been tortured.  Their wounds were rotten and stinking.  A major came to the cell at 1AM and ordered me to step aside. ‘These people need to be killed immediately,’ he said.  But I refused.  I told him those were not my instructions.  He pushed and screamed, but eventually he stormed off.  The prisoners were released a few days later, but someone followed them out and killed them.  It was a sign of things to come.(Kigali, Rwanda)




(4/4)  We didn’t lose a single person.  After hiding out for three weeks, we were rescued by the Rwandan Patriotic Front.  Everyone came running in from the fields.  All of us were cheering.  In the end, over three hundred people survived the genocide by hiding in this church.  I can’t remember all their faces.  Life has taken us to many different corners.  And some of them have left the country to begin new lives.  But many of them still call me father.  I’ve given away the bride in several different wedding ceremonies.  Occasionally people will randomly show up on my doorstep with drinks.  I’ll say to them: ‘You were with us in the church, weren’t you?’  And we’ll embrace.  When I look back, I believe the genocide could have been stopped if more pastors had taken a stand.  We were the ones with influence.  The killers belonged to our congregations.  And we could have held them back.  But instead we did nothing.  And every pastor had a different excuse.  Some said they didn’t know things would get so bad.  Some said they were too afraid.  And some said the government was too powerful to oppose.  But when you’re standing aside while people die, every excuse is a lame one.    (Kigali, Rwanda) 


 The next time the killers came, there were fifty of them.  All of them had guns or machetes.  They pushed straight past me and entered the pastor’s residence.  They began pulling people out of the ceiling.  They were kicking us and dragging us along the floor.  I knew this was the end.  I could see our death clearly.  Some people were shivering and wailing and screaming for mercy.  Others were completely silent.  They’d already lost so many loved ones and they were ready to die themselves.  We were dragged to this very spot and put in three lines.  We began to say our last prayers.  I scanned the mob of killers for recognizable faces.  Many of them were Christians.  Some were even from my congregation.  Every time I recognized a face, I called to him by name.  I said: ‘When I die, I am going to heaven.  Where will you go?’  Then I pointed to the next man, and asked him the same question.  Then the next.  Then the next.   Some of the killers grew nervous.  They began to argue amongst themselves.  Nobody wanted to be the first to kill.  Soon they were threatening to shoot each other.  And they began to leave, one by one, until all of them had run off.            (Kigali, Rwanda)


(2/4) We filled every hiding place with a person.  Some were in the ceiling.  Some were in the cupboards.  Some were under the floor.  There were even two people in this toilet.  That very first evening the militia came to my front gate.  Some were carrying guns.  Others were carrying machetes.  They’d been told that I was hiding people.  They demanded to come inside and search the property.  I stood in the doorway and told them that they’d have to kill me first.  ‘We’ll be back,’ they said. ‘And thanks for gathering the cockroaches into one place.  Because it will be easier to kill them here.’  Days passed by.  We were an abandoned, dying group.  Our food ran out quickly.  Thankfully some church members answered my call, and agreed to sneak us food after dark.  The nights were the worst.  We could hear gunfire and screaming in the surrounding hills.  Always we thought we were next.  Nobody was sleeping.  My wife and I lost so much weight.  All our friends abandoned us.  They pretended not to know us.  Only one pastor stood by our side.  He came to me one night and warned me that there was a plan to attack the church.  I told the news to my wife, and we both agreed that we were ready to die.(Kigali, Rwanda)




 First came the meetings.  They were openly advertised on community microphones.  Their stated purpose was to discuss ‘current issues,’ but everyone knew that killings were being organized.  These things were being openly discussed on the radio at the time.  I was always invited to these meetings, but I never attended.  I was a pastor.  I wanted no part in those discussions.  But when the killings finally commenced on April 7th, people came running to my church for sanctuary.  The first of them arrived early in the morning.  They were trembling and too scared to speak.  All they could say was: ‘Hide us, hide us.’  I told everyone to go inside the church.  I said: ‘If our God is true, we will be OK.’  Finally a young man arrived who was able to talk.  ‘They killed my parents,’ he said. ‘All of us are being hunted.’  I was also terrified but I tried not to show it.  I just kept bringing people inside the gate.  By the time the sun went down, there were over three hundred people hiding on this property.(Kigali, Rwanda)




On April 6th 1994, an airplane carrying the President of Rwanda was shot down over the capital city of Kigali, serving as a catalyst for genocide against the minority Tutsi population.  One million people were killed over the next 100 days. It was one of the most violent episodes in human history.  The stories from that time can be traumatizing to hear.  Living through them is nearly unimaginable.  But in the wake of this tragedy, an equally unlikely story has unfolded.  It is the story of Rwanda’s recovery and reconciliation.  Rwanda has become one of Africa’s model economies.  Its streets are clean and safe.  Over one million tourists visit each year.  If you walk through Kigali today, it’s difficult to imagine the events that occurred less than twenty-five years ago.  But the stories are still there.  And you can’t listen to them without being reminded of humanity’s capacity for violence and the fragility of peace.  During my week in Rwanda, I focused on the stories of people who took a moral stand during the genocide.  These are members of the Hutu majority who risked their lives to shield and protect Tutsis.  In Rwanda they are known as ‘The Rescuers.’  Over the next several days, I will be sharing their stories.




I thought it was a prank.  I was only twenty years old.  It was the first time we’d ever had sex.  We discussed ending the pregnancy but I begged her to consider keeping it.  Both of our families were supportive.  I promised that I would provide. And once we decided to keep the child, I started earning money however I could.  I learned to print t-shirts and do graphic design.  I sold my phone to buy a camera.  My mother even took out a loan to help me buy it.  There was no photography school in this country, so I had to learn everything myself.  I took so many pictures of my daughter growing up.  My mother would sit for lighting practice.  I watched YouTube videos.  I watched every single class on Creative Live.  Finally I got good enough that someone hired me to take pictures of their party.  Then I moved on to weddings and corporate events.  Now my dream is to become a documentary photographer.  There are so many stories to tell in this country, but very few outlets will publish them.  That hasn’t stopped me though.  I’ve photographed a slaughterhouse with horrible conditions.  I’ve interviewed World War II veterans across the country.  Last year I spent three days documenting a ‘women-only’ village in Kenya.  Nobody would publish the work so I paid for the trip with my savings.  My wife has been so supportive.  She helps me edit the photos.  One day I’m hoping to sell my stories to international media.  And if I’m able to establish myself, I’d like to begin my own photography school in Ghana.  (Accra, Ghana)




I wanted to be a billionaire by the age of thirty.  It was a literal goal.  I wanted to be the African version of Bill Gates or Warren Buffett.  My parents always told me to work hard, and the money will come.  It just seemed like the prize you got for checking all the boxes.  And I always checked the boxes.  I made straight A’s.  I went to Howard University.  I worked at Goldman Sachs after graduating.  The plan was to make money, build relationships, then return to Ghana and create some businesses.  But my first business took too long to get off the ground.  Then I got frustrated and poured all my savings into another business.  Both of them were self-sustaining for a while, but it’s been a struggle since then.  Right now I’m trying to raise more funds and it’s not going well.  And I’m a far reach from where I wanted to be.  My confidence is shaken.  I’m unsure of my next step.  And I’m approaching forty.  I’m trying to manage the disappointment by changing my perspective.  I try to remind myself that I have a beautiful wife and son.  I’ve employed people.  And I’ve had some great experiences.  I no longer feel the need to be a billionaire.  My new goal is to have a successful business that I can work at every day.  But in the back of my mind, I keep wondering: ‘Am I developing a more realistic perspective?  Or is this what quitting sounds like?’  (Accra, Ghana)




When I remember that December is coming, I get anxious.  We pay rent at the end of the year and we don’t have it.  We’re saving all we can but we’re only halfway there.  My husband sells kabobs but it’s not going well.  I’m selling bananas to help out.  My children are wearing torn school uniforms.  I can only afford books for some of them.  I prioritize by who will get in the least amount of trouble with their teachers.  The smallest one doesn’t have any books right now, because I need the oldest one to get high marks.  I don’t know what I’ll do if we get evicted.  But I bounce back.  I’m a happy person.  And all of the shopkeepers around here are my friends.  We keep each other distracted.  We play jokes on each other.  We make each other laugh.  And we share what we have.  Some of them are drivers, and if they drive out to the province, they’ll bring back food for me.  So life can be good.  Things are manageable.  And I’m fine as long as I stay busy.  I only withdraw when I remember the challenges I have.  (Accra, Ghana)




There’s no decorum in this country when it comes to childbirth.  Our society expects you to have children.  People start watching your stomach immediately after marriage.  Soon the questions begin from family, friends, and eventually complete strangers.  Thankfully I have a supportive partner, because we went through seven miscarriages and two stillbirths.  The pressure from family was unbearable.  I was made to drink potions.  I bathed in holy water.  At one point I was even stripped naked in front of people to be scanned in the spirit realm.  It doesn’t matter how much education you have.  You get to the point where you’ll try anything.  You don’t feel like a woman anymore.  After years of trying, we finally visited a special doctor who said: ‘There’s nothing wrong with you.  Go on holiday.  Enjoy life.’  We dismissed his opinion because we’d given up, but nine months later our son was born.  Today I have three children.  Because of my difficulties, I try to help women who are going through the same thing.  I run a little community called My Sister’s Keeper.  We offer free therapy and fertility counseling for women who are having trouble.  But mainly it’s a place to cool off.  To get a free spa treatment.  To feel like a woman.  And to think about anything but having a baby.(Accra, Ghana)


(3/3) It’s not easy being king.  I have to follow many of the old rituals.  I cannot be seen in public without an escort.  I must always eat alone.  And the power isn’t what it used to be.  We’re living in a different time.  We aren’t battling for territory anymore.  We aren’t petitioning the colonies.  The palace still rules on minor disputes, but mainly my power is indirect.  I advocate for my people when the national government is setting its agenda.  I enjoy the role.  I want to improve the lives of all my subjects.  I want them to have clean water.  I want them to have quality education.  But my main focus is development.  I want our kingdom to become a tourist hub.  The income would transform so many lives, and we have so much to offer.  We have a beautiful river.  We have a great history.  And we have some of the oldest artifacts in Ghana.  In 1680 the Dutch built a castle on our shores, and my people captured it.  It was the first time in history that a black man owned a castle.  We held it for several years.  Eventually we gave it back, on one condition: they had to let us keep the keys.(Akwamufie, Ghana)
(2/3)  After I was granted asylum, I moved in with some cousins in the Bronx.  My first job was washing dishes in the kitchen of an adult home.  I was paid $297 every two weeks.  But I noticed that the private nursing assistants were paid a lot more, so I enrolled in some classes and received my certification.  My first assignment was a quadriplegic named Hector.  I ended up staying with him for six years.  I fed him, changed his diapers, helped him go to the bathroom, everything.  I really loved him.  We went all over the place.  We drove to Chicago and California.  My shift was the overnight, so sometimes I’d drive him to the club and he’d go dancing in his wheelchair.  I’d stand right next to him the entire time.  During the day I took classes at Lehman College.  I majored in health services.  After my graduation, the whispers began once more.  Family members were urging me to come home and take my rightful position on the throne.  So I said ‘goodbye’ to Hector and moved back to Ghana.  I got a job in business until the last king passed away in 2011.  And this time when the elders called on me, I was ready. (Akwamufie, Ghana)




(1/3)  I’m the 29th King of the Akwamu Empire.  Three hundred years ago we ruled the entire southern part of Ghana.  The English described us as ‘bullies.’  The Danes described us as ‘thieves.’  Today I have 120 towns under my jurisdiction.  But I didn’t always want to be king.  I knew from a young age that it was a possibility.  I’m from the royal bloodline.  But I just hoped they’d choose someone else.  I was in college the first time they tried to coronate me.  I was studying accounting.  I heard a rumor that the king had passed away and that I would be next.  So I panicked.  I googled ‘political asylum.’  I took someone else’s passport.  I didn’t even bother to change the picture.  I’d never left Ghana before, but I took a one-way flight to New York City.  I presented myself at the JFK customs counter, and said:  ‘You have to help me. They’re trying to make me king.’ (Akwamufie, Ghana)




When I was eighteen, a large group of students visited Ghana from the UK for a youth development program.  It was an expensive program.  It cost thousands of pounds.  But I got to join for free because they needed some Ghanaians for a smattering of cultural diversity.  The program was a mixture of community service and adventure.  We actually came canoeing on this very lake.  The whole time I was thinking about how much money was being made from our natural resources.  And how much of that money was leaving Ghana.  I became determined to make Ghana money out of the Ghana environment.  So after graduating college, I set out to build a world-class adventure company.  It’s been over five years now.  We have twelve full time employees and twenty-five adventure locations.  Best of all, I think we’re creating an adventure culture in the country.  Our clients were 70 percent foreign when we started.  Now they’re 80 percent Ghanaian.  Behind me is Survival Island.  It’s my latest project and biggest risk yet.  I constructed a full ropes course, and one day I hope to build the world’s longest zip line.  That would really put Ghana on the adventure map.(Accra, Ghana)




It first happened when I was trying to save money for high school.  A man offered to help me.  He’d give me food sometimes.  I’d cook for him and watch his children.  But then one night he asked me to sleep with him, and I refused, so he locked the door and raped me.  A different boss forced himself on me during a trip and gave me $100 to keep quiet.  It’s happened about ten times.  It’s not just employers.  It’s anyone who offers to help.  I’m very religious and my faith would never allow me to do such a thing.  But I’m not strong enough.  There are times when I’m so desperate.  I have kids.  I can’t buy food.  I can’t buy prescriptions.  And someone offers help.  They tell me they just want to help, but I know in the back of my mind what’s going to happen.  I go with them because I have no choice.  And I feel so much guilt afterwards.  Of course I don’t tell anyone.  I just cry and pray for forgiveness.(Accra, Ghana)


A few years ago my marriage was breaking down.  I was depressed.  I wanted to leave.  But when I tried speaking to my friends about it, most people told me to ‘suck it up.’  They told me not to be selfish, and to think of my children.  Church members told me that I’d go to hell.  Family members told me that an unhappy marriage was better than being alone.  Above all, everyone told me to keep quiet.  There’s a taboo in our culture against ‘airing dirty laundry.’  Therapy is stigmatized.  So I had nobody to talk to.  During that time, I’d lock myself up for days and cry.  Luckily there was Qwarme.  We grew up together.  We’ve been friends since high school.  He understood me.   But most of all, he just listened.  The experience gave us an idea to start a listening channel for other people who needed to talk.  I bought a new phone number.  We put out a call on social media, inviting anyone to call in anonymously and share their problems.  I do most of the listening.  But if they’d rather speak to a male, then Qwarme steps in.  We’ve helped almost seventy people in the last three years.  It’s become a round-the-clock job.  Some people call us every day.  Others will call once a month but talk for hours.  Occasionally we’ll recommend a therapist if it seems like professional help is needed.  But other than that, we just listen.  And for most people, that’s enough.(Accra, Ghana)




My mom was left with eight children when my father died.  I had to help raise my siblings because I was the oldest.  I tried working as a seamstress, but it wasn’t enough.  I had to supplement my income by selling eggs.  I’d buy my eggs every morning from the same woman.  But one morning she sold me bad eggs.  Twenty crates of them.  They were too small to sell.  But I just started praying, and I heard a voice telling me to come to this spot.  By the end of the day I’d sold every crate.  And this is where my business has been ever since.  I raised my siblings with this business.  I bought land.  I got married.  I divorced my womanizing husband.  I raised my children.  And then I raised my siblings’ children.  I did it all on my own.  I’ve never had help from anybody.  But without this business, I’d have been helpless.  (Accra, Ghana)




I was eighteen years old.  I went out one night with a male cousin and his friends.  I felt safe with him.  But he gave me a drink and I started to not feel like myself.  He took me home to his house.  It was dark inside and I could hear people moving around.  I heard murmuring in the shadows.  I tried to lock myself in the washroom.  But they beat down the door.  It lasted all night.  They took turns.  I was still a virgin when it happened.  I had goals for myself.  I’d started reading at a very young age.  I wanted to go to school.  But that night everything changed.  I didn’t leave my bedroom for months.  I wasn’t going to tell anyone.  But unfortunately for me, I got pregnant.  I was forced to tell my family.  My father didn’t believe me.  He said: ‘If you’re old enough to get pregnant, you’re old enough to live on your own.’  He kicked me out of the house.  He told me: ‘You’ve used your body once.  You can use it again.’  I had to beg on the street.  I’d go for days without eating.  I hid in the bushes outside my house and begged my siblings for food.  But they avoided me like I was a disease.  I had to abort the baby.  I wasn’t mad at the child, but I had no choice.  I was completely alone.  That was twenty years ago, and I survived.  I’m financially comfortable now.  And maybe I’ve found some peace.  But I’ve never healed.  I don’t want anyone in my life.  I got married once but I hated the sex too much.  Even then I felt alone.  I’ll always live like I have nobody.  I’ve made a few friends, but in the back of my mind, I’m on my own.  Because I don’t want to feel vulnerable.  I don’t want to feel weak.  I don’t want to cry.  I don’t ever want to need anyone again.(Accra, Ghana)




My father wants me to work in government, but I think there are plenty of problems we can solve ourselves.  So I’d rather be an entrepreneur.  Two issues we have in this country are erratic power and excess trash.  So recently I’ve been dreaming of a waste-to-energy plant.  It could be a solution to both problems.  I’ve been researching on the Internet for months.  The technology exists.  But this morning I had a meeting with the electric company, and they told me the power supply is currently stable.  There isn’t a market for extra energy.  So I’m feeling a little disappointed. But I’m going to explore other ideas.  I’m also researching methods to manufacture furniture with leftover sugarcane fiber.  I just want to do something about all this waste.  It makes me so angry.  Our gutters are filled.  Our bins are overflowing.  I’ve been carrying this trash for a mile because there’s nowhere to put it.  And nobody feels responsibility for the problem.  In the village where I grew up, everything was clean.  Because everyone viewed the land as their own.  I wish we’d view our entire country like that.  Personally, I don’t want anyone calling Ghana dirty.(Accra, Ghana)




We had a big discussion whether to raise him in Africa or move to the states.  We both grew up in Ghana.  But I got my PhD in West Virginia, so moving to America was an option.  The job opportunities would certainly be better there.  Both of us are professors, and you’d probably laugh if you knew what we got paid here.  Healthcare would be better too.  You don’t hear of people dying in America because they can’t find an open hospital bed.  But despite these things, we decided to raise our son here.  Because he’d never have to think about the color of his skin.  We never have to explain what it means to be black.  Or the rules of being black.  One day in West Virginia I got an Amber Alert on my phone.  All it said was: ‘tall black male.’  I was the only one in sight so I nearly panicked.  Then another day I was walking back to my dormitory.  I’d just finished teaching a course.  Someone drove by in a red truck, threw a hamburger at my head, and called me the ‘N Word.’  It was 3 o’clock in the afternoon.  I don’t want to explain that stuff to my child.  It’s exhausting to be conscious of your skin all the time.  You either become militant or you become defeated.  And I understand why it happens, but extremes of anything aren’t good.  (Accra, Ghana)


My mother had a lot of problems in her life, so I grew up without her.  It was a difficult childhood.  Everything that I’ve accomplished came from the kindness of others.  My first angel was my grandmother, who let me live with her.  My second angel was my first grade teacher.  Her name was Madam Felicia.  I had no confidence when I met her.  I thought I was dull because I never did well on my examinations.  But she saw greatness in me.  She taught me how to study and think.  Then in fourth grade I met my third angel, Madam Faustina.  She was also my teacher.  After hearing my story, I think she decided to take me as her son.  She promised to support me as long as I worked hard.  She grew me up.  She taught me the Bible.  She paid for my books and school fees.  I’m in university now, but even yesterday she called to see if I needed anything.  I’m currently studying to be a lecturer.  I’m taking three different majors.  I want to help people.  It’s only natural because of all the people who helped me.  I feel like there are so many people out there who can do great things, but are doomed unless they find someone to help them.  (Accra, Ghana)


My parents didn’t have any money, so I began living with my uncle when I was fifteen.  For years he treated me like his own son.  Anything I asked of him, he would give me.  We played music together.  We sang in the choir together.  But when he met a new woman, everything changed.  He suddenly decided to stop providing for me.  I couldn’t buy myself food or clothes anymore.  I felt betrayed.  So I snuck into his room and took some money from his drawer.  His new girlfriend caught me.  And she told my uncle when he came home.  I cried when he confronted me.  But there was nothing I could say.  I knew that I had to leave the house.  My situation was desperate.  I had nothing to eat.  I moved in with a friend, and some days we’d share a single bowl of curry.  I was forced to figure things out.  I began to work harder.  I found a job as a cleaner.  Now I’m studying to be a chef.   I’m twenty-five years old, and for the first time in my life I’m standing on my own two feet.  I haven’t spoken to my uncle since that day.  But I’m going to see him in a couple weeks.  I realize now that I was too old to be depending on him.  I felt entitled to his generosity.  And when he took it away, I betrayed him.  He wanted me to become a man.  So I want to tell him that I understand.  And ‘thank you.’  And ‘I’m sorry.'(Accra, Ghana)


I had some experience with abuse as a young child.  Victims are shamed in our culture, so I couldn’t talk to anyone.  I had to deal with it myself.  I had to grow out of it.  I tried to cope by reading books about the human brain.  I learned how to heal, and move on, and not be bitter.  Only later did I discover that all this was something called ‘psychology.’  I only wanted to get to the point where I didn’t feel shame anymore.  And the more I learned, the more I became determined to feel comfortable with sex.  I joined sex forums online.  I experimented.  I had threesomes.  Eventually I learned so much that I decided to become an educator.  I’ve moderated about fifteen discussions so far.  I call it: ‘The Sex Talk.’  I’ve spoken at church groups.  I’ve spoken at schools.  And it’s taken a lot of courage.  Because people in this country think that if you’re speaking about it, you’re encouraging it. But I think secrecy is what’s harmful.  Why not explain sex to kids?  We show them how to do everything else.  They need to know that these feelings are natural, and that they have a brain to keep them in check.  Either we educate people about sex, or they’ll be confused by it.  And if they’re confused by it, they’ll be shamed by it.  And if they’re shamed by it, they’ll be controlled by it.   (Accra, Ghana)


I’m on the way to buy soft drinks for my mother.  I also fetch water, and sweep, and help her wash clothes.  She calls me ‘boss’ because I work so hard, but I love to help her because she cares for me so much.  She buys me clothes.  She reads me storybooks.  She sings me gospel songs.  She helps me with my homework.  She gives me medicine when I’m sick.  One time she baked my friend a cake because his parents couldn’t afford any presents.  I’m going to buy her a house one day. She’s very dark and beautiful.  I really have a wonderful mother.  (Accra, Ghana)


My husband is a mechanic, but his business is slow.  It’s not enough.  I’m selling this so my children can go to school.  I want them to go above me.  I want them to be a great someone in this country.  When I see them happy, I feel happy.  Every time I pay their school fees, they tell me: ‘Mommy you are the best mommy.’  So I’m out here all day in the sun.  Then I go home, I cook, I bathe, I put them to bed, and then I go to sleep.  I’ve been sick with malaria this past week.  I haven’t been able to work.  My husband wants me to rest but the kids are beginning to cry from hunger.  The stress is too much for him alone.  When I was lying in bed, I just kept praying: ‘God, help me go sell.’  But every time I went outside, my fever was too much.  My body felt too cold.  And I had to go back inside.  Today is my first day back to work.  I woke up with no headache, but it’s so bad right now.  There’s pain all over my body.  I’m just hoping to sell enough to buy tomorrow’s supply.

The first time I was offered a journalism job in Nigeria, the newspaper owner suggested that I supplement my income with bribes.  He told me: ‘I’m giving you a platform.  Use what you have to get what you need.’  I knew then that the rumors were true.  Journalism in this country was corrupted.  There was no idealism.  Reporters were writing stories for money.  And even more damaging, they were killing stories for money.  I didn’t want to participate.  I felt it would be more ethical to just find a corporate job.  But in 2008, I was given the opportunity to manage a new paper founded by Nigeria’s only Pulitzer Prize winner, Dele Olojede.  The paper was called Next.  And we tried to change things.  We hired young people who were untainted by the culture.  Half of them were women.  We paid them well and we trained them well.  Ethics came first.  Accepting gifts was absolutely forbidden.  Our paper survived for three years.  During that time, we broke major stories every single week.  We exposed all sorts of corruption.  But we were targeted for our success.  Our reporters were detained.  Our board members were threatened.  The government leaned on our advertisers, and they withdrew one by one.  Eventually we were forced to close.  But for three years we set the pace.  We created a mold.  And I believe we changed the media landscape.  Investigative journalism is stronger now.  Many of our journalists have gone on to start amazing publications of their own.  The paper may have been short lived, but I know it had an impact.  Revolution is too strong of a word, but we definitely shook the table.(Lagos, Nigeria)


I want to live a happy life.  I’m tired of living a poor life.  I’m trying to save money for school but nothing is working.  I’ve left home three different times looking for work.  The first time I found a job as a housekeeper.  But every morning when I got dressed the man would try to touch me.  I was only seventeen.  He wouldn’t even stop when I threatened to tell on him.  His wife blamed me for his attention. She beat me severely.  There were bruises all over my body.  She didn’t even allow me to eat.  But I tried to stay because I wanted to go to school so badly.  Then one morning he tried to rape me in the bath, and I finally ran away.  When I found a new housekeeping job, the same thing happened.  This time it was a pastor.  So a few weeks ago I switched to a cleaning job at an art gallery.  But they just fired me for speaking to the visitors.  I don’t know why this always happens to me.  It makes me so angry.  I get mad at my parents for being poor.  I get mad at my friends for going to school.  When I see their graduation pictures on Facebook, I just start crying.  I’m already twenty years old.  I should be finishing school, but I haven’t even started yet.  But everything has it’s own time.  Hopefully my time will come too.  (Lagos, Nigeria)


My uncle was an engineer.  He’s the one that exposed me to reading.  He’d get a book, finish it, and give it to me.  By the time I was twenty I’d read over one thousand books.  I learned how to live from the characters I encountered.  The first book I ever read was The Passport of Malam Illia, and to this day it’s the reason I never take vengeance.  And there’s plenty to be angry about around here.  Most of my friends are poor.  When we were growing up, police would come to the slum in the evening, pick up my friends, and beat them for no reason.  It made me so angry.  But books also taught me that we have the power to change things.  We can fight for lower fuel prices.  We can fight for better medical facilities.  I’m actually heading to a protest right now.  We haven’t had electricity in this slum for ten days.  Why?  Because last month we protested and now they’re trying to punish us.  But we won’t sit down.  Too many poor people don’t realize their own power because they’ve been subjugated for too long.  They’re like the chickens I keep in my house.  Every time I whistle, the chickens come.  Even when I don’t have food in my hand.  And that’s how people think.  They believe that only government has the power to give.  But anything the government has power to give, we have the power to take for ourselves.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




My father died young, but my mother was well-to-do.  I was an only child and she took care of me well.  She promised me at a young age that she’d send me to Oxford University.  So I studied hard.  My best subject was English.  I wanted to be a lecturer.  But my mother passed away the same year that I graduated high school.  She’d been sick for so long.  Our assets were depleted from the hospital bills.  There were no jobs in our village, so I came to the city looking for greener pastures.  I taught myself to sew, and now I make men’s suits.  It’s not the type of work I wanted to do.  I’m tired all the time.  Business is slow.  Life is expensive.  It’s frustrating when you work twelve hours a day and can’t even feed your family well.  We don’t have a television.  We don’t have a radio.  Because everything I have left, I spend on their school.  They’re good students.  I encourage them to study hard.  I always tell them to focus because I want them to go far.  And anything I can remember from school, I teach them myself.  (Lagos, Nigeria)


It wasn’t sudden.  He was born four months early.  The organs didn’t have enough time to mature.  He just wasn’t ready for life.  But he held on for more than two years.  He was such a happy child.  He laughed so hard when you rocked him.  We called him ‘Bibi,’ because his older brother couldn’t say ‘baby.’  Toward the end, he was learning to stand on his own.  We honestly thought he was going to make it.  But his immune system was just too weak from all the medication.  And his lungs were too weak from all the machines.  He couldn’t survive.  I had a hard childhood growing up.  This place makes you tough.  Nigerians and cockroaches will be the last living things on this planet.  I can remember being nine years old, and sitting down with my brothers to make a plan when we ran out of food.  Our only idea was to drink a lot of water.  So I’ve always had to be strong.  When my brother died, I couldn’t mourn.  I was the oldest in the family.  I had to hold it together and make arrangements.  But not this time.  After Bibi, I decided that I don’t ever have to be strong again.  That was my child.  I can’t button this one up.  Either I allow myself to be weak, or I’m never going to get through it.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




I had a lonely childhood.  I didn’t have many friends.  I spent a lot of time writing depressing poetry in my room.  But everything changed the first time I saw someone perform a spoken word poem.  It was at a fellowship meeting.  I never realized that poetry could impact an audience like that.  After the meeting, the girl invited me to join her poetry club.  There were seven members.  They met every Thursday under a guava tree in the school courtyard.  It was a place for me to just write, and to read what I’d written.  It was a place where I felt accepted and got critical feedback.  I got better at writing.  I grew more confident.  Eventually I performed in front of larger audiences, and my projects got more ambitious.  Now I’m working on a book.  It’s been my main focus for the last four years.  It’s about a little girl who’s misunderstood.  She’s an artist.  She wants to be recognized and understood.  But everyone around her thinks she’s a witch.  When I began writing the book, the character was based on myself.  But I’m so different than her now.  I’m not depressed anymore.  I’m closer to my family.  I don’t feel so isolated.  But I’m not sure she’s gotten there yet.   I’m struggling to not impose my growth onto her journey.  As a writer you’re supposed to detach yourself from your character.  But when you’ve included so many elements of yourself, and you’ve evolved so much, it’s really hard to do.  (Lagos, Nigeria)


I’m a community leader here.  I watch over about eighty people.  We meet every month, and I try to bring their concerns to the government.  They also look to me for guidance on how to vote.  Hardly any of them are educated.  Most of us have nothing.  I’m lucky because I work as a street cleaner, but my salary hasn’t been paid in three months.  But if we try to feed ourselves by hawking articles on the side of the road, the government will put us in jail.  We need jobs.  We need clean water.  We need good roads.  The politicians promise these things before every election.  They visit the neighborhood, and tell us this time it will be different.  But after the election they disappear.  I’ve been to the minister’s office so many times.  Every time his receptionist tells me that he’s in a meeting.  I sit there all day.  The meeting never ends.  But he’ll show up again when the election comes around, carrying eighty packages of noodles, and a polo shirt with his name on it.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




I attribute my success to getting to know God early in life.  Where I grew up, it was easy to go wayward.  And it was risky to go wayward.  Thankfully I studied the Bible enough to know the definition of sin.  It taught me right from wrong.  If I’d been out there trying to figure it out myself, I’d have taken too many wrong turns.  I’d probably have gotten pregnant at a young age.  I definitely wouldn’t be an architect right now.  Maybe some people can do it without God.   But not many people in my neighborhood were reading books about morality and ethics.  We weren’t being taught the seven habits of highly effective people.  But we did have the word of God.  I relied on it.  And it carried me through. (Lagos, Nigeria)


I just drove by a man being beaten by police.  He was a bus driver.  He’d been pulled from his bus, pinned to the ground, and beaten with sticks in front of his passengers.  It’s not uncommon.  He probably refused to pay their bribe.  I see it two or three times a month.  Sometimes it’s fists.  Sometimes it’s sticks.  Sometimes it’s whips.  You can try to take a photo but it’s dangerous.  Because then they can turn on you.  So you just keep driving.  It makes me sick because I work as a driver, and I know that one day it might happen to me.  I never drive through yellow lights.  It’s too dangerous.  Sometimes they’ll even force you into a violation.  They’ll purposely direct you the wrong way down a ‘one way’ street.  If that happens, you don’t argue.  You don’t try to defend yourself.  You will lose no matter what.  You just start begging.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




It happened in May.  I was driving my friend’s Mercedes to school because my car had broken down.  And suddenly I got pulled over.  I turned on the interior lights.  I showed the policemen my ID.  I called my friend on the phone and asked him to explain the situation.  But they said: ‘Not enough, get out of the car.’  They started calling me a prostitute.  I told them I’m an artist.  Then they saw my laptop in the backseat, and they tried calling me an Internet scammer.  They asked me to open my computer and type in the password.  I told them it wasn’t possible.  Then they asked for a huge bribe, and I told them it wasn’t possible.  That’s when they cocked their guns at me.  One of them got in the front seat.  He pointed his gun at me and told me to drive to an ATM.  I brought him to this exact spot, and he escorted me to the machine.  I left the car running.  I maxed out one of my cards, and told him that I have go back and get another one.  Then I locked the door and started driving away.  That’s when he started shooting at me!  All of this was captured on surveillance cameras.  I sped away.  I was taking short cuts and back roads.  The whole time I was thinking I’m about to get killed.  When I got home, I found four dents in the car from where the bullets hit.  Afterwards I contacted the police, and they said they wouldn’t even speak to me unless I deleted the story from social media.  I said: ‘I’m not doing that.  I’m a law student.’ (Lagos, Nigeria)




They’re called Yahoo Boys.  The name comes from the old days when they used Yahoo email accounts to scam people.  I first started seeing them when I went to the University of Lagos.  They form little gangs.  They travel in convoys where all the cars are the same color.  They’re always on their laptops.  These days a lot of them are legitimized.  They rent office space.  They refer to their targets as ‘clients.’  They start charities.  They put their fraud money into other businesses.  Some of them have Instagram accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.  They post pictures of their cars and clothes.  They never mention where they got their money, but everyone knows.  A lot of them buy art from me.  Since a lot of their scams are emotional fraud, they’ll even ask me for advice on things that women would say in a relationship.  Or they’ll ask me to pick up their phone and pretend to be a secretary.  I never participate.   Recently I’ve even stopped selling them paintings.  It’s cost me a lot.  But I can’t take their money without feeling complicit.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




When I was the age of this boy, my father had a stroke.  My family used all our savings to take care of him.  And after we’d spent everything, my father gave up the ghost.  We were left in a desperate situation.  There was no money left.  There were six of us living in a single room.  I was only in 5th grade, but I had to go to work.  I carried oranges on my head and sold them in the street.  Then one day I met the owner of a print shop.  He was a friend of my brother.  He fed me every afternoon, and he began to teach me his profession.  He told me: ‘Never view yourself as having nothing.’  And he showed me that I could change my life with skills alone.  Now I have my own shop.  And anyone who has an interest, I will teach them.  I’ve taught fourteen boys already.  This boy has stopped going to school.  But we can’t allow him to be idle.  We must keep him busy because there’s criminality all around us.  Every day we see drug dealers walk by.  I point to them and I ask: ‘Do you want to be like them?  Or do you want to be like me?’(Lagos, Nigeria)




My mother won the visa lottery, so when I was young my family relocated to Minnesota.  I think I’m the only one of my siblings who always viewed Nigeria as home.  I participated in Model UN.  I studied international political science.  I admired Nelson Mandela.  So I always knew I’d go back to Africa one day.  After graduation I interned with an NGO in Northern Nigeria.  During that trip I witnessed a breached birth in a village.  There was no C-Section available, so the baby died.  I knew then that not only would I be coming home to Nigeria, but I’d be doing something in healthcare.  I’ve been home for six years now.  I’ve chosen to work on the country’s blood distribution problem.  Every year tens of thousands of people die while waiting for blood.  Meanwhile there are blood banks discarding unused inventory.  My company LifeBank is trying to close that gap.  Most blood banks in Lagos are participating in our program.  Every morning we take an inventory.  And when blood is urgently needed, we use bikes to deliver.  It’s not easy.  Imagine New York City without the infrastructure and no subway system.  That’s Lagos.  Yet LifeBank has delivered over 10,000 bags of blood within 55 minutes.  Blood shortage is a global problem.  And if we can do it in Lagos, we can do it anywhere.  In December we’re expanding to two new cities.  But I see us all over the world.  (Lagos, Nigeria)




Shortly after arriving in Lagos, my guide showed me a story that was being passed around Nigerian social media.  There was a woman who’d been stopped in traffic behind a crowded prison truck, and she witnessed a food vendor running alongside, shoving his food between the bars of the window, into the hands of the prisoners inside. By the time he was finished, he’d given away all his food.  The man was himself in desperate circumstances.  He was sleeping outdoors.  But despite having hardly anything to give, he gave away all his merchandise.  Amazingly, my guide Kola was able to locate the man.  His name is Ibere Ugochukwu.  And this is his story:   A few years ago I worked as an apprentice in a cosmetics shop.  I was supposed to receive a payment at the end of my term.  But I was warned by the other employees that the owner would find a reason not to pay me.  He’d always invent reasons to fire his boys right before their payment.  So I made the decision to quit.  But when I told him, he dragged me to the police.  He told them lies about me.  He told them I’d stolen so much money.  And they tortured me.  They tied my hands and legs and they hung me from the ceiling.  They beat me.  I went deaf from all the slaps.  For ten days I was given no food.  My fellow prisoners would share little bits of their meals when they were finished.  But some days I saw nothing.  Honestly I was about to die.  And I started to pray to God.  And on the tenth day, the guards decided that it would cause too much trouble to let me die.  They told my employer: ‘After what we did to him, he must be innocent.  Because he’d have confessed if he was guilty.'  They released me into the world like a madman.  And I’ve carried the memory ever since.  I promised myself that if I ever found someone in a similar situation, I would help.  So when I learned that prisoners pass down this road, I chose to hawk in this location.  I waited until I finally saw the truck, and I pushed all my food through the bars.  My fellow vendors couldn’t believe it.  They asked me who would pay me for the food.  I told them: ‘I didn’t do it for any man.  I did it because of what God did for me.’  (Lagos, Nigeria)




I’m studying human development.  A few years ago I came across an article that said there were no successful black nations in the world.  It really angered me.  I thought: ‘Some fellow is trying to run us down.’  But then I discovered the author of the article was Nigerian.  And the more I read, the more I realized it was true.  And I started to think that maybe we should be mad at ourselves.  I always hear my friends complaining about the politicians in this country.  I tell them: ‘Imagine that lightning strikes and suddenly you’re the president.  Would you know enough honest people to form a government?’  And they freeze.  Because our culture doesn’t ascribe a premium to honesty.  People will laugh at you for being honest and broke.  Nigeria has the highest concentration of black people in the world.  So this is where it should happen.  But development doesn’t begin with things, it begins with people.  I’m not saying that self-criticism is the answer.  But it’s the beginning of the answer.  Maybe we should be a little less proud and a little more discontent.  Maybe we should stop blaming our immorality on poverty.  I grew up in the slums and I don’t want to hear it.  Don’t blame it on colonialism, nepotism, racism, or any of the ‘isms.’  And don’t blame it on the slave trade.  Because slavery didn’t begin with white people.  White people purchased slaves from our shores, that’s true.  But black people did the selling.  And we were paid for what we sold. (Lagos, Nigeria)




In my church you’re either Christian or possessed by demons. We have services four times per week.  Luckily zoning out looks a lot like praying.  I’m not saying that I don’t believe any of it.  I just have a lot of questions that nobody will answer.  Whenever I ask a hard question, they just show me a bible quote that says I shouldn’t ask questions.  It doesn’t make sense to me.  I think I’m becoming a Nihilist.  Honestly, I don’t see any reason why people should be born.  You exist, then you strive to attain something to make sense of your existence, and then you don’t exist anymore.  Can’t we cut out some of those steps?  It’s just too much work.  I didn’t sign up for this.  And when you finally die, instead of everything stopping, you have to become conscious again?  Heaven doesn’t sound that great.  Supposedly there’s a lot of singing and trumpets.  That sounds exhausting.  I’d rather be sleeping.(Lagos, Nigeria)




You can’t just use Beyoncé to sell products in Nigeria.  Well, maybe Beyoncé is a bad example.  Beyoncé can sell anywhere.  But most of the time you need to adapt your advertising to local tastes.  So I help international companies create marketing campaigns for Nigeria.  A few years ago I started my own company.  I’d gotten tired of working for someone else.  I was doing all the work on some projects, and I’d only walk away with peanuts.  So I took the leap.  My goal was to win a single bid that first year.  I just needed one big name to risk a little money on me.  Because a little money to them was a lot of money to me.  I knew I had the technical experience.  I had the ‘know how.’  I just didn’t have an office, or a staff, or a big name.  But that became my pitch.  I argued that bigger agencies take their clients for granted.  I told companies: ‘I’m not relaxed like that.  I’m hungry.  I’m going to give you more juice.’  My first client ended up being Coca Cola.   Maybe I didn’t have things quite as figured out as I allowed them to believe.  But hey, that’s advertising.  And I delivered.(Lagos, Nigeria)




I used to walk 12 kilometers to school.  And every day along the side of the road, there’d be an old woman who was so sick that she couldn’t move.  The sun would beat her.  The rain would beat her.  And nobody would help.  I was only seven years old.  I couldn’t stand it.  But my parents wouldn’t agree to bring a total stranger into our house.  How are we OK with people dying like chickens on the side of the road?  Millions of people in this country haven’t even taken a single meal today.  I can’t stand it.  I’m thirty now and I’m struggling.  But I’m still trying to help even though I don’t have money.  I taught myself to treat diabetes with herbs.  I’ve treated ten people so far who can’t afford the hospital.   But I want to do more.  I’ve given myself a timeframe.  I’ve been working at this conservation center for three years now, and I’ve learned a lot.  In a few years I’m going to open my own center.  I can use the profits to build houses for people who have no place to stay.  Each person can stay for a year.  Maybe if they can just rest their head for a month, they’ll find a way to feed themselves.  And if they eat for a week, they’ll start to reason like a human being.  At the very least they’ll see that it’s possible to be loved by someone.  And maybe they’ll realize that God loves them too.(Lagos, Nigeria)




I was a baby when I got married.  I was only thirteen.  I didn’t have an adolescence.  One day I’m a child going to school, and the next day I’m a mother, responsible for a home.  I cried too much.  I didn’t know the person I married.  He turned out to be a cold man.  He had zero communication or understanding.  I suffered for so long, but I endured it all so that I could raise my children well.  But every human has a ceiling, and once you hit it, it’s over.  For three years I planned my escape.  I waited until my children were older.  Then one morning I left the keys on the table, dropped my kids off at school, and headed straight for the courts.  I finally have freedom.  I’m laid back.  I’m relaxed.  I can express my opinion.  I do whatever I want.  I just finished a wonderful vacation in Egypt with my daughter.  Nobody causes me trouble anymore.  These are the best years of my life.  (Cairo, Egypt)




When I was a boy I’d skip school to sell roses on the street.  My parents gave up trying to educate me.  They said: ‘He’s lost his mind over the roses.’  I wanted to be around flowers all the time.  I sold so many that I opened my own kiosk across from a famous country club.  But I could never sell on Fridays.  The police would close our entire street so the governor could visit the club.  But once I ignored their instructions.  It was the day before Mother’s Day.  My biggest day of the year.  So I took a chance and remained open.  When the police found out, they confiscated all my flowers.  They even took my license.  It was a fatal blow.  All my money was in those flowers.  I had piles of them.  So I had to start from zero.  I’m a street vendor again.  For awhile I was ashamed, but I’m fine with it now.  It’s better than working for someone.  I buy the roses I want, and sell them to whoever I want.  Maybe I’ll have a shop again.  But as long as I’m around my roses, I’ll always feel peaceful.  (Cairo, Egypt)




My mom has nobody to care for her but me.  The last stroke affected her brain so badly.  She’s like the living dead.  All she can do now is breathe.  Last month I found a small wound on her toe.  I thought it was something small.  It looked so small.  So I just put a bandage on it.  But it was the beginning of gangrene.  I should have known.  It spread and the doctors had to amputate her leg.  It’s all my fault, but I was under so much pressure.  I’m a single mom.  I work as a housekeeper.  What do I focus on? What do I pay for?  My kids’ education?  Food?  My mom’s care?  It’s just too much.  It’s all on me.  I called my sister last week and screamed at her.  I screamed at her for never calling.  I screamed at her for not helping.  I told her that I wished she would die.   And my wish came true.  Four days ago she passed away.  When I saw her at the morgue, she had no hair, no eyebrows, nothing.  She had been hiding cancer from us.  I feel so guilty.  My wish came true.  But I didn’t know because she never called!  I haven’t eaten since yesterday.  Only a cup of milk.  I can’t keep doing this. It’s too much pressure.  I’m not doing well.  I’m not OK.(Cairo, Egypt)


I read a lot on the subject.  I studied the texts.  And I decided it was permissible to take it off, so that’s what I did.  My mom was terrified of what people would think.  She asked me to delete all our mutual friends on Facebook.  She said if I didn’t wear the hijab, then I couldn’t live at home.  So I packed four big bags and went to live with a friend.  It was the first time I’d ever slept out of my house.  Over the next few weeks, I sent my parents messages every single day.  I always told them where I was, what I was doing, and who I was with.  I wanted to show that I forgave them, and that I was still their girl, and that one day things would be normal again.  They didn’t respond for three months.  Until one holiday my uncle called and invited me home for dinner.  My parents started crying as soon as I walked in the door.  They’d prepared a huge meal.  They said that they didn’t mean it, and that they love me a lot, and that they’re proud of me.  Things are very good now.  We get along even better than when I obeyed.  They see I’m doing great things with my freedom.  I have a great job and I travel.  They’re very proud.  I’ve learned to do what you want in life.  Because if you do, the world will change to match you.  (Alexandria, Egypt)




The entrepreneurial community in Egypt is a bit like a baby.  It’s still learning to speak, and to read, and to understand.  It exists, but only a small number of people have access.  You must have connections. Because without them, it’s impossible to grow a business.  There are too many layers of bureaucracy.  Every decision requires a permit, and every permit requires a signature. A business can be stalled for months waiting on a single approval.  Unless you have connections, then everything can be fixed with a single phone call.  This dynamic must change.  The system needs to work for everybody.  The country will never be competitive unless entrepreneurs are able to move fast.  But I don’t think the answer is government.  The answer is entrepreneurship itself.  Our start-ups must begin making money. Because money means control.  And when entrepreneurs are in control, things will start working.(Cairo, Egypt)




My husband died a long time ago.  He was in a car accident.  My daughter was only four years old at the time, and I was pregnant with my son.  But I overcame it all.  Life is difficult but God is generous.  I found a job working at this building.  I’m an old lady now, but if anything is needed from the store, or anything needs to be cleaned, I can still do it.  I’ve been here for 50 years, in a little apartment on the roof.  I raised my children up there.  All of the people in the building love me.  They’re like my family.  They tell me: ‘Anything you need for your house, just let us know.’  Whenever I’m sick, they always call me.  They say: ‘Where were you yesterday?’  And it’s not just the people in this building.  The whole neighborhood loves me.  I mean, they’re practically my own.  I raised every one of them.   (Cairo, Egypt)


I was married when I was seventeen.  My whole life was my family.  I barely left the house because my husband brought me everything I needed.  I was far too innocent.  I had no idea about anything, but the world has a way of teaching you.  Fifteen years ago my husband died and I had to take the lead of the family.  He owned an upholstery shop.  The workers tried to convince me to let them handle the business, but they were hiding the profits from me.  I had to take over.  There was no other choice.  My kids were still in school and that money belonged to them.  So I began going to the shop every day.  At first the workers tried to box me out.  They knew I didn’t understand the business so they wouldn’t explain anything.  They hid the numbers from me.  And when a client entered the store, they wouldn’t even introduce me as the owner.  But I sat there and watched every move they made.  I memorized everything.  And after forty days, there were some new rules at the shop.  The workers were not allowed to speak to the client directly.(Cairo, Egypt)


I’ve had horrible luck finding a husband.  Most marriages in this country are traditional, and I have a middleman who arranges interviews with potential suitors.  He probably thinks I’m a snob.  Because I either turn the men down or scare them off.  But you should hear the questions they ask me.  Nothing about personality.  Nothing about character.  Everything is about money: ‘What is your salary?’,  ‘Do you have a car?,  ‘Is this your only apartment?’  I used to answer these questions, but I’m much harsher now.  I’ll dismiss them right away.  I’ve had men ask me to stop working.  I had a professor ask me to stop studying because I have more degrees than him.  Another man ended the interview when he learned that my ‘doctorate’ did not mean I was a medical doctor.  It’s ridiculous.  Some friends and family want me to settle for the sake of having children.  But I have a viewpoint, and I’m not going to sacrifice that viewpoint just because I’m getting older.  I believe in marriage.  And I’d like children.  But if it means I have to accept anything, maybe it’s best to not get married at all.(Alexandria, Egypt)


This is my brother.  We’re helping people into their parking spots.  School starts in a few days and we’re trying to raise money for our school fees.  Also I want to get a bicycle because all my friends have bicycles.  They use their bicycles to make me angry because I don’t have one.  But wait until I get my bicycle.  They’ll be so angry.  We’ve been saving our money for three months.  But sometimes we buy Pepsi.  And also peanuts.  And yesterday a street vendor came by with jewelry, and my brother bought me this necklace.  And he also bought me a watch but it broke.  And a ring but I lost it.  He really loves me so much.   (Cairo, Egypt)


He always wanted a daughter.  He tells me that all the time.  My friends think I’m so lucky because a lot of their dads aren’t affectionate.  Some have even been forced to stop studying and get married.  But my father wants me to be successful.  He wants me to live abroad.  More than anything, he’s a friend. There was a time in high school when I was extremely depressed.  Mostly just teenage things.  I felt ugly.  I didn’t have confidence.  But it got so bad that I started having scary thoughts.  And I didn’t want to tell anyone, especially my parents.  I was afraid I’d get locked away in the house.  But one night we were sitting in my bedroom, and I finally let him know.  His reaction wasn’t what I expected.  He didn’t panic or scream.  He was calm.  He just kept holding me and saying: ‘We’ll get through this together.’(Alexandria, Egypt)


Mom said: "You wear this, and you wear that.'"  (Alexandria, Egypt)


I’d always dreamed of getting a college degree, but I got married right after high school.  We started having children right away, so it wasn’t easy to convince my husband to let me study.  The one time I tried to mention it, he immediately said ‘no.’  But a few years later we were in the passport office and I saw an advertisement for a university.  I pulled on his sleeve, pointed at the sign, and said: ‘Lets take a look.  It’s only a look.’  That very same day I enrolled in classes.  Each night I’d wait until 2 AM, after everyone’s demands had been answered, and the whole house was asleep.  Then I’d begin my studying. I’d work until morning, wake the children up, and prepare them for school.  Only then could I rest.  It was exhausting but I was so happy.  It felt like I’d gone back in time and my kids were my siblings.  During my third year I was pregnant again, and I was terrified that I’d go into labor during my final exams.  But I got my diploma.  It was the happiest day of my life.  My husband was thrilled for me.  Everything is different now.  I understand the world.  I used to be afraid to leave the house.  But now I feel powerful.  And it shows.  (Cairo, Egypt)


My parents aren’t giving me the freedom to be responsible.  Mama’s fine.  But Papa is an Egyptian father.  He wants me to always be in a safe, cozy home.  Recently I wanted to go on an educational trip to Sri Lanka.  I begged him.  I said, ‘Please, I’ll be living with a family.  I’ll call you ten times a day.’  But he wouldn’t listen.  I locked myself in my room and cried.  I wanted that experience.  I wanted to meet beautiful people, and eat beautiful food, and take beautiful photos.  I know my dad very well.  He just doesn’t trust people.  He thinks that I’m naïve.  He thinks that everyone who helps you wants something in return.  But that’s not why I help people.  I love people.  I love languages.  I can even speak a little Hindi.  I want to see every village and every city.  I even want to work for NASA one day.  I love physics and astronomy.  But Papa thinks astronomy is a bad idea.  He doesn’t get it.  It’s not that he doesn’t understand the stars.  He just doesn’t understand me.  (Alexandria, Egypt)


I’m from Basra.  In the seventies we were the economic capital of Iraq.  It was beautiful once.  The only city with two rivers.  We had one million people but ten million palm trees.  In those days everyone was optimistic.  Our oil reserves were better than the Saudis.  We assumed the oil would be invested, and that our lives would keep getting better.  But our leaders failed us.  It was war after war.  Without all the fighting, things could have really been great.  But the palm trees are gone now.  There’s no potable water.  We have a shortage of electricity.  Healthcare is very poor, and cancer is everywhere because the Americans used radioactive bombs.  Our whole land is contaminated.  The food that comes from the soil is poison.  But please visit, you’ll be welcome.  The people are friendly.  You’ll be met with hospitality.  We understand that governments are the warmongers.  You’re victims just like us.  (Cairo, Egypt)


I have two young boys.  And every time we go somewhere, I’m not even thinking about my fun.  I only think about their fun.  I’ve been to the zoo a million times because the small one loves the monkeys.  Last week we went to see Hotel Transylvania III.  I’ve already seen two of those things.  This time the monsters took a vacation.  To be honest, I don’t even think there was a story.  The monsters just kept interacting with people on the boat.  I wasn’t really paying attention, but the boys loved it.  I enjoyed their reactions more than the movie.  I watched their faces the entire time.  And whenever they laughed, I laughed.   (Cairo, Egypt)


My mom is in prison.  I see her every fifteen days.  My siblings take me to visit her, but then they leave me when it’s over.  My grandmother doesn’t want me.  My uncle beats me up.  I have nowhere to live.  The only person I have in my life is my mom.  Every time I visit, she asks me if I’m staying with relatives, and I tell her: ‘Mom, nobody wants me.  I have no one.’  I sleep on the street.  I can’t go to school.  I just hang out with the older kids.  Sometimes we wash cars together for money.  Last week I was washing a man’s car and he bought me clothes and food.  He told me I could sleep at his house.  So maybe I’ll start going there.(Cairo, Egypt)


Papa loves Ibrahim.  He’s my beloved.  He’s my whole world.  I have four other sons, but I love him a little more because he needs it a little more.  The doctors recommended an abortion but I wouldn’t hear it.  He was only three pounds when he was born.  He needed half a liter of milk per day.  I’d skip my own breakfast just to buy it for him.  I took him to nurseries when he was very young because I wanted him to be comfortable with other children.  I found a charity that offered speech classes, and I took him five days a week.  Anything that I have, I will give him.  I only worry what will happen when I’m gone.  I’m getting old.  I had a major heart episode two weeks ago.  I collapsed in the street and all I could think about was him.  My wife can't support him alone, and I’m afraid other people won’t be as nice to him.  If someone makes him angry, he’s very difficult to control.  But I have patience.  I’ll hold him.  I’ll pat him on the shoulder.  I’ll do whatever he needs.  I just hope he'll always have someone to do the same.
